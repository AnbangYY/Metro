# D2C Feedback

A great solution to the D2C tasks.

I appreciate your use of map data structures in your handling of the game tasks. Code quality is typically very good, but I encourage you to consider how you will integrate your other classes you designed for the skeleton into your implementation.

You will find that having a more convenient representation of game data will assist you massively in completing the AI exercises in the later portion of the assignment (and earlier).

The Viewer is of excellent quality. Collaboration via Git is clear.
