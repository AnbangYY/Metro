Good use of separate tests for assessing different corner cases for task six. I appreciate the breadth of your testing,
and your tests are very well labelled. Remember to use Java method naming convention (camel case) with method names.

Particularly with your `GetPointsTest` tests, it's good to see manually generated test data that covers a number of
different corner cases in the scoring logic. Well labelled test data, and good documentation for tests.
