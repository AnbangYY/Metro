comments:
- Generally great design of code. Lan created 2 buttons to implement the idea of drawing card from the deck, and choose card from hand. By making the two buttons classes,
  Lan put the logics of drawing and choosing cards in each of the button, and this harnesses the object orientation feature of JAVA to avoid making a single method too
  chunky and hard to read. With a makePlayerControls method that generates these two buttons, the main method could just call the makePlayerControls method to get everything
  on display. The GridBackGround method helps to get the cilcks on board to become an action which puts the tile in right position. With the two buttons providing boolean
  state of whether it is clicked, the GridBackGround method puts the tile accordingly on right position. 
  
- These two parts of code mainly creates button inner classes that contain main logic of the buttons. It is good use of object-orientation concept. But this can also be implemented
  by creating several methods that generate these buttons. 
  
- The code is well documented, logics of code are listed clearly. 

- The code also follows JAVA coding convention.
